# High-Performance Distributed Database Benchmarking

## Objective
The goal of this project is to benchmark high-performance distributed databases to assess their scalability, efficiency, and performance under different loads and configurations.

## Methodology
- Select a distributed database platform (e.g., Apache Cassandra, MongoDB).
- Define benchmarking scenarios and load tests.
- Use benchmarking tools to simulate real-world workloads.
- Collect and analyze performance metrics such as latency, throughput, and resource utilization.

## Expected Outcomes
- Detailed performance analysis of the chosen distributed database.
- Recommendations for configuration optimizations.
- Insights into the scalability of the database under various workloads.
